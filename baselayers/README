This directory should be empty in the ideal case. However, if there is a
problem with the Juju Charms baselayers, place the base layers to be included
in this directory.

Example to get a previous version of the "basic" layer:
git submodule add https://github.com/juju-solutions/layer-basic.git baselayers/basic
cd baselayers/basic
git checkout 26ece6b3192bfb2b61e12740a05d5822cfedf496
